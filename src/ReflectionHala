I found it fun to work on this project and to work with the data that we collected. It made me more open to coding with other people and to learn from others. Sophia always knew how to fix the code whenever I felt stuck and she was amazing. It was intersting to see how differnt data sturctures can be used differently in this project and having to choose the one that works the best of what we were trying to achieve.
