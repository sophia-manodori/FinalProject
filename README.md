## Development Journal

Sunday Dec 3rd: decided to make our own data set.

Monday Dec 4th: made a survey to collect data(added more questions to the form to collect additional data allowing for more computations).

Tuesday Dec 5th: read in the file to create a social network, added nodes and edges. Wrote add person method. 

Friday Dec 8th: created find hobby method, and all non-recursive methods. 

Saturday Dec 9th: Started working on recursive methods, and switched from using arraylist to hashset to avoid repeating values and for easy removal. We chose this mainly to ensure that with recursive methods that may traverse the same nodes several times, it wouldn't have an repeating name.

Sunday Dec 10th: Finished mutual friends method. 

Monday Dec 11th: Cleaned data, made movie/book/tv recommendations methods. Made main with cases for interactions. 

Tuesday Dec 12: Finished main, finished recursive methods that use degree of friendship to search. 


## Reflection
Sophia's reflection: I had a lot of fun on this assignment. It was nice to apply the things we've been learning in class to a project that is so implementable in my daily life. Modeling my and many other people's friend groups was a lot of fun, and it was really nice to see people actually find their mutual friends and get excitied about it. I was also really fun to see things like graphs, arrays, hashmaps, and recursion all get implemented in one place. Working with Hala was really fun too, she is super good at testing methods and finding what doesn't work and what does.
